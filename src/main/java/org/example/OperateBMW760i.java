// This class is an implementation of the OperateClass interface

// It is often called a "Concrete" class for this reason.

// specifically for controlling the electronic/mechanical parts of a BMW760i.
// All methods in the interface are implemented, thus allowing the remote
// car driving system to control this car.
//
// The software would be installed in the car's computer, and then
// the remote driving system could make calls to this software
// using the methods defined by the interface.
